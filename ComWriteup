In this module, I focus on understanding how to use Linux commands more effectively. I learn how to find help for commands using tools like man (manual pages), --help, and info. I also explore how to chain commands together using pipes (|) to pass output from one command to another, and how to use redirection (>, >>) to save output to files. Additionally, I get familiar with wildcard characters (*, ?) for matching filenames and using grep to search through text.
