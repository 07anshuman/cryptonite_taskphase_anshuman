The module introduces basic Linux concepts. I start by learning how to navigate the terminal using commands like cd (change directory), ls (list directory contents), and pwd (print working directory). It also covers basic file operations such as creating (touch), reading (cat), and deleting files (rm). There's a focus on understanding file permissions and using commands like chmod to modify them. The exercises help I practice these commands in a Linux environment, giving I a solid foundation in terminal usage.
