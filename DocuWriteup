In this module, I learn about the importance of documentation in Linux and how to effectively read and understand it. I explore different types of documentation, such as man pages, info pages, and online resources. I practice using commands like man, info, and whatis to find information about commands and their options. Additionally, I discover how to search for specific terms within man pages and use apropos to find commands related to a keyword.

This module emphasizes the significance of documentation as a resource for troubleshooting and learning, helping me develop the skills to find the information I need when working in Linux.
